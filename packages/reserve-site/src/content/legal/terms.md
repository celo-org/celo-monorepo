###  Governing Law & Jurisdiction
These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, and you submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Cayman Islands for the resolution of any disputes.   A Party shall give prompt written notice of any Dispute to the other Party (a "Dispute Notice").  Such Dispute Notice will include sufficient details of the Dispute to enable the other Party to consider its position in relation to the Dispute.  Each Party agrees to use its best efforts to settle any Dispute amicably between the Parties within a period of 30 days from receipt of the Dispute Notice.
In the event that a Dispute is not settled amicably then either Party may, by notice in writing to the other Party, request a mediation to be administered by a neutral party acceptable to both Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree on the identity of a mediator within a period of 14 days from the delivery of such notice, either Party may invoke the mediation procedures of the London Court of International Arbitration (the "LCIA"), who shall appoint a mediator.  The venue of the mediation shall be the Cayman Islands.
Any Dispute not resolved through negotiation or mediation shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration conducted in English, according to LCIA Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”), and before one (1) arbitrator to be appointed in accordance with the Rules.  The costs of the arbitration, including the Parties' attorneys' fees and expenses, shall be paid at the discretion of and pursuant to the decision of the arbitrator. The seat of the arbitration shall be the Cayman Islands. 
During such time as any Dispute is being resolved or determined by negotiation, mediation or arbitration, the Parties shall continue to comply with their respective obligations under these Terms.
