Collection of Data

A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. 

###  Use of Data
To make our Site more intuitive and easier to use we may collect data on how many times the Site is visited, which countries those visits come from, and what devices are used to view it.  We do this in a way that is in no way personally identifiable to you. This data is necessary for our legitimate interests in monitoring how our Site is used to help us improve the Site, and the information and tools available on the Site.
Additionally, the information we obtain in this manner may include your device characteristics, language preferences, referring/exit pages, and dates and times of visits to our Site. The information we collect  helps us (1) understand how you use and interact with our website and (2) otherwise enhance our website, and help ensure it is working properly. Your Device IP Address may  be temporarily stored in our web logs, it is however not associated with the above data.
