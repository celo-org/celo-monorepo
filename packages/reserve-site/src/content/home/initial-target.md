title: Initial Reserve Target
---

The initial reserve targets the following allocation (based on protocol [governance](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/governance)) over time. 
The initial CELO amount allocated to the reserve may be diversified into other non-CELO crypto assets, the market fluctuates constantly and the reserve rebalances systematically, so the actual holdings will be off-target initially. Reserve trades are generally done on exchanges (following best execution principles), with some of the initial diversification trades being done OTC, with multi-year lock-ups on CELO sold. A primary upside of using crypto assets in the Reserve is that all user transactions with the Reserve can happen on-chain, in a decentralized and fully-auditable way.
