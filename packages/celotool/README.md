### How to Setup a Local Celo Blockchain Node

You might need to setup a local node for some reasons, therefore `celotooljs` provides you with
a few useful commands to make running a node really easy.

- Clone [Celo Blockchain repo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain)
- Build `celotooljs geth build --geth-dir <directory-where-you-cloned-geth-repo> -c`
- Init `celotooljs geth init --geth-dir <directory-where-you-cloned-geth-repo> --data-dir <geth-data-dir> -e <env-name>`
- Run `celotooljs geth run --geth-dir <directory-where-you-cloned-geth-repo> --data-dir <geth-data-dir> --sync-mode <full | fast | light | ultralight>`

### How to Deploy a Test Network to the Cloud

- Setup the environment variables: MNEMONIC, GETH_ACCOUNT_SECRET, and ETHSTATS_WEBSOCKETSECRET.

- Deploy: `celotooljs deploy initial testnet -e yourname`

- Get pods: `kubectl get pods -n yourname`

- Start shell: `kubectl exec -n podname -it podname /bin/sh`

- Tear down: `celotooljs deploy destroy testnet -e yourname`

#### MacOS Setup

- Install Helm 2.14.0 from https://get.helm.sh/ (Homebrew lacks this version.)
To get past the Unidentified Developer error: open the directory containing helm, then ctrl-click helm and select Open then Open again.  Repeat for tiller.
