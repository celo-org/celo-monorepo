   * @dev Used to keep track of the status of a breaker for a specific rate feed.
   *
   * - TradingMode: Represents the trading mode the breaker is in for a rate feed.
   *                This uses a bitmask approach, meaning each bit represents a
   *                different trading mode. The final trading mode of the rate feed
   *                is obtained by applying a logical OR operation to the TradingMode
   *                of all breakers associated with that rate feed. This allows multiple
   *                breakers to contribute to the final trading mode simultaneously.
   *                Possible values:
   *                0: bidirectional trading.
   *                1: inflow only.
   *                2: outflow only.
   *                3: trading halted.
   *
   * - LastUpdatedTime: Records the last time the breaker status was updated. This is
   *                    used to manage cooldown periods before the breaker can be reset.
   *
   * - Enabled:     Indicates whether the breaker is enabled for the associated rate feed.
