# Celo DAppKit

DAppKit is a lightweight set of functions that allow mobile DApps to work with the Celo Wallet to sign transactions and access the user's account. This allows for a better user experience: DApps can focus on a great native experience without having to worry about key management. It also provides a simpler development experience, as no state or connection management is necessary. Since version `1.1.0-beta.1`, DAppKit also offers beta support for web DApps that are designed to run in a mobile browser and work with the Celo Wallet.
