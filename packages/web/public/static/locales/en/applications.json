  "cashTransfersText1":
    "Studies have shown that cash transfer programs have a positive impact on populations plagued by extreme poverty. However, the cost associated with delivering this form of aid remains high due to lack of reliable identity and financial infrastructure as well as fraud and corruption. Billions of people remain unbanked and/or without a formal, legal identity and hence without a path towards prosperity. With Celo, anyone has access to a mobile wallet to receive payments.",

    "In the US, apps like Venmo and Square’s Cash app make it easy to pay a friend back for lunch. In many parts of the world, a similar experience does not exist in the local market. Celo makes it easy to send stable digital payments to any mobile phone anywhere, in a censorship resistant manner.",

    "Celo aims to be the world’s first truly accessible mobile cryptocurrency. Anyone with an Android smartphone can earn Celo currency into existence. ",
  "getPaidText2":
    "Today, “mining” cryptocurrencies typically requires specialized hardware, technical expertise and an electricity budget that make cryptocurrencies inaccessible to a large portion of the world’s population. Instead, Celo rewards users for powering its phone verification service by using a user’s excess phone plan capacity. As cryptocurrencies are becoming an integral part of the global financial infrastructure, we not only want to provide the best possible tools to manage and transfer funds but also make access to cryptocurrency itself easier.",
