We believe blockchain technology is one of the most exciting innovations in recent history and as a team we look to push the boundaries of what is possible with it today.\n\nMore importantly, we are driven by purpose – to solve real-world problems such as lack of access to sound currency, or friction for cash-transfer programs aimed to alleviate poverty.",
