# Planning
Planning your event doesnâ€™t have to be overwhelming. Here are resources that the Celo Community has created to plan their own events. They are tried and tested so have confidence that by using these templates you can run a successful Celo event.
These resources are living, breathing documents. We encourage you to add comments and additions as you learn from your own experiences. Remember to:

1.  Submit your event to the Celo Foundation so we can help promote it
2.  Connect with other Celo event organizers on our Discord #community channel.
