## Quick Tips
**Pre-event**

* Invite people to your event with personality and a personal touch - don’t just share the logistics of where & when, but share the why and make the event inviting.

**Post-event**

* Send post-event “thank you” notes to your guests along with a short feedback survey
* Invite any newcomers into your online community - meetup, FB group, mailing list, etc. 
* Consider inviting a prior participant to help lead the next event. The more you can involve community members in event organizing, the easier it will be to maintain the community.
