# Event Resources

Excited to create your first event? When planning a Celo event there are a few best practices to follow:

*  **Find a co-organizer**. Recruit a friend or community member to help you run events and build your community. Community management is more sustainable with help. And it’s more fun! 
*  **Get comfortable with delegating.** As you recognize enthusiastic community members, invite them to help you with event organizing. An engaged community is a happy community. 
*  **Lead with your passion.** Being a community organizer is sustainable only when we are driven by what matters to us. Stay rooted in your “why” for building community. 
*  **Welcome feedback.** Be an active listener to member needs and interests. If you’re ever stuck on how to move forward, listening to your community will guide you forward. Direct your “why” towards serving your members. 
*  **Give your community a home.** Having an online forum for communications and building relationships in between events is crucial to build and sustain your community. Meetup, FB groups, WhatsApp, Telegram, and google groups are all options for staying connected.
