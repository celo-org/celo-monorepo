## Sponsorship
There are limited microgrants available for Celo community events. Sponsorship can take the form of:

*  Gifts (swag) 
*  Food / Drink 
*  Venue rental
*  Speakers (limited availability)
*  Speaker & community leadership training

Event requirements for sponsorship consideration:

*  Mention of Celo and its mission during the event, directing people to celo.org and other relevant Call to Actions 
*  Clear event objectives and plans
*  Planning 6-8 weeks ahead of target date
*  Organizer commitment to following social media best practices & completing post-event survey
*  Organizer commitment to one event a quarter


Microgrants are not designed for large-scale events. As a best practice, The Celo Foundation recommends collaborating with other relevant organizations to expand your local network of resources and reach a wider audience.  
Request sponsorship in your event submission to The Celo Foundation, and we will reach out to you with next steps through the contact info you provide.
