description: We believe that, to create a truly inclusive financial system, we must begin by serving those who need it most.

Globally, about one in every three adults do not have a bank account.  As a simple consequence of this, they don’t have a straightforward means of receiving or storing value across distance, and therefore are excluded from a large part of the global economy. They don’t have a way of establishing assets or credit history on which to receive loans. They can’t receive remittances without a large processing fee. In this context, the simple ability to store and transmit small quantities of money with little overhead can have a transformative impact.  
We believe that to create a truly inclusive financial system, we must start by building an infrastructure to serve those excluded from the current system. Further, we believe that if we are able do so, the resulting system will be more useful, more resilient, more full-featured, and more accessible for everybody.  
Therefore, when we design our tools, we keep in the front of our mind the people who need them the most.  This is our primary motivation.
