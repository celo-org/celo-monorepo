To do any of the things we aim to do -- design for many people, innovate on the medium of exchange, strive to create beauty in the little things -- requires us to be humble, to be empathetic, to learn from our mistakes and othersâ€™ successes.  Even more than audacity, doing anything meaningful requires humility.
