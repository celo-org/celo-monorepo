title: 3. Striving for Beauty
description: We aim, as best we can, to create beauty.

There are two twin truths around which we orient our values and culture: that each person has a unique purpose, and that everyone is connected.  We believe that a financial environment that supports both of these complementary truths -- that connects us to one another and supports each person in following their own path -- can help to create a more beautiful world.  So, too, we believe that a working environment that supports these truths -- that fosters our intrinsic connectedness to one another, and gives focus to each personâ€™s unique purpose through project choice and thoughtful reflection -- can help to create a more beautiful working community.  Therefore, we strive to lean into these truths.  More generally, we try, as much as possible, to create beauty in each of the little things we do.
