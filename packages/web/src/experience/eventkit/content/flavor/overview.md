# Celo Flavor


Prosperity for the Celo community is: people getting their basic needs met, people following their unique path, and people supporting one another. 

The focus on cultivating prosperity is what gives events the “Celo” flavor. These common characteristics, as well as the suggested event ideas below, are designed to support that intention.
