## Foster learning & growing

Communities that learn together grow together. Choose event themes and topics that foster the learning and growth of your local community. This requires first knowing who your audience is. Consider the people in your local circles who would be interested in Celo’s mission. What commonalities do they share? What’s their technical level? What are they interested in learning about? Use these questions to create events that meet their needs and contribute to growth.
