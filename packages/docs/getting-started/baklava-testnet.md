# Baklava Beta Network

The Baklava Beta Network is the second Celo test network after **Alfajores testnet**. It is a demonstration of the current Celo codebase. You can use it to participate in the [The Great Celo Stake Off](https://forum.celo.org/t/the-great-celo-stake-off-the-details/136/2).

You have some instructions about running the network by operating a [full node](running-a-full-node.md) or a [validator](running-a-validator.md) on your machine \(or on a cloud or hosting provider\).

Please refer to [Key Concepts](../overview.md#background-and-key-concepts) for background on blockchains and an explanation of terms used in the section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Baklava, the incentivized testnet for the Celo Protocol. It is an early, partially audited release betanet version of the Celo Protocol. The Great Celo Stake Off allows eligible participants to engage with Baklava and, related to that participation and subject to these Terms and Conditions, eligible participants will have the opportunity to receive Celo Gold at the Mainnet launch of the Celo Protocol. The Great Celo Stake Off will operate in phases, with each phase focusing on a different part of the protocol or infrastructure to test. Transitions between each phase may include a full network reset, a hard fork, or an upgrade.
