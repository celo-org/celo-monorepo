# Baklava Beta Network

The Baklava Beta Network is the second Celo test network after **Alfajores testnet**. It is a demonstration of the current Celo codebase. You can use it to participate in the [The Great Celo Stake Off](https://forum.celo.org/t/the-great-celo-stake-off-the-details/136/2).

You have some instructions about running the network by operating a [full node](running-a-full-node.md) or a [validator](running-a-validator.md) on your machine \(or on a cloud or hosting provider\).

Please refer to [Key Concepts](../overview.md#background-and-key-concepts) for background on blockchains and an explanation of terms used in the section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Baklava Bet Network is designed for testing and experimentation by developers. Its tokens hold no real world economic value. The testnet software will be upgraded and the entirety of its data reset on a regular basis. This will erase your accounts, their balance and your transaction history. The testnet software will be upgraded on a regular basis. You may encounter bugs and limitations with the software and documentation.
{% endhint %}
