# Choosing a network

The best place to start exploring Celo depends on your interests and objectives:

* **[Alfajores](alfajores-testnet.md), the Developer Testnet**: If you're a developer considering building on the Celo platform, or want to try out the [Celo Wallet](https://celo.org/build/wallet), start with [Alfajores](alfajores-testnet.md). You can [obtain a balance](https://celo.org/build/faucet) immediately and use it for experimenting with. The [SDK tutorials](../developer-resources/start.md) assume you are using Alfajores. The network is managed by cLabs, who operate all of its validators, and its software and deployed contracts will track mainnet.

* **[Baklava](baklava-testnet.md), the Node Operator Testnet**: If you're interested in operating one or more nodes that make up Celo's infrastructure, start with [Baklava](baklava-testnet.md). Baklava's validators and full nodes are operated by the community. It is intended to provide a venue to test new builds of the Celo Blockchain software, trial on-chain governance proposals, and for node operators to build operational best practices. Support for developers and users of the Wallet is not the primary focus.

* **[Release Candidate 1](rc1.md):** This network will become the Celo Mainnet and is being deployed by the Celo community starting 4/22/20. Most of the activity is being driven by the validator organisations that featured on the leaderboard of [The Great Celo Stake Off](https://forum.celo.org/t/the-great-celo-stake-off-the-details/136).
