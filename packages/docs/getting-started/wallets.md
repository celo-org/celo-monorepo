# Digital Wallets for Celo

## Choosing a Wallet

Wallets are tools that create accounts, manage keys, and help users transact on the Celo network.

It's important to be careful when choosing a wallet because they manage your secret account keys. You should only use reputable wallets that are well maintained by organizations/people that you trust.

The [Celo Native Wallets](#celo-native-wallets) section shows some popular wallets that were built specifically for the Celo network. They often include features that more general wallets do not, like paying for fees with cUSD. The [Celo Compatible Wallets](#celo-compatible-wallets) section has wallets that can work with Celo but were built for other networks (like Ethereum) or through company partnerships (like Pesabase).

## Celo Compatible Wallets

There are currently a few other compatible wallets. When the upcoming [Donut hard-fork](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/issues/94) is live, Celo transactions will become compatible with Ethereum transactions. This will allow some Ethereum wallets to work with Celo. More updates on this coming soon.

### Wallet Connect

Strictly speaking, wallet connect is not a wallet; it is an open protocol for connecting wallets to Dapps. Celo wallets are implementing Wallet Connect version 2, so dapp developers should use V2 as well. You can learn more about getting started with wallet connect on Celo with [this tutorial](../developer-resources/walkthroughs/wallet-connect.md).
