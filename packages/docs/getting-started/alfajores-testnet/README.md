# Alfajores Testnet

The **Alfajores Testnet** is a Celo test network for developers building on the Celo platform. You can use it to try out the [Celo Wallet](https://celo.org/build/wallet) or the [Celo CLI](../../command-line-interface/introduction.md) \(by sending transfers to yourself or other users of the testnet\). You can also assist in running the network by operating a [full node](../mainnet/running-a-full-node-in-mainnet.md) on your machine \(or on a cloud or hosting provider\).

The [Baklava Testnet](../baklava-testnet/) is focused on building operational experience and best practices for node operators.

Please refer to [Key Concepts](../../overview.md#background-and-key-concepts) for background on blockchains and an explanation of terms used in the section.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Alfajores Testnet is designed for testing and experimentation by developers. Its tokens hold no real world economic value. The testnet software will be upgraded and the entirety of its data reset on a regular basis. This will erase your accounts, their balance and your transaction history. The testnet software will be upgraded on a regular basis. You may encounter bugs and limitations with the software and documentation.
