# Wallets

## Choosing a Wallet

Wallets are tools that create accounts, manage keys, and help users transact on the Celo network.

It's important to be careful when choosing a wallet because they manage your secret account keys. You should only use reputable wallets that are well maintained by organizations/people that you trust.

The [Celo Native Wallets](./#celo-native-wallets) section shows some popular wallets that were built specifically for the Celo network. They often include features that more general wallets do not, like paying for fees with cUSD. The [Celo Compatible Wallets](./#celo-compatible-wallets) section has wallets that can work with Celo but were built for other networks \(like Ethereum\) or through company partnerships \(like Pesabase\).

## Celo Compatible Wallets

There are currently a few other compatible wallets. When the upcoming [Donut hard-fork](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/issues/94) is live, Celo transactions will become compatible with Ethereum transactions. This will allow some Ethereum wallets to work with Celo. More updates on this coming soon.

### Wallet Connect

Strictly speaking, wallet connect is not a wallet; it is an open protocol for connecting wallets to Dapps. Celo wallets are implementing Wallet Connect version 2, so dapp developers should use V2 as well.
