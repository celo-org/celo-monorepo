# Using the Mobile Wallet

One easy way to experiment with the Alfajores Testnet is to install the Celo Mobile Wallet. This section explains how to download the wallet and how to get invited onto the network.

### Getting Started

Since verifying your phone number costs gas, you have to be invited to the platform to have the funds to pay for the verification process. To do so, please visit [celo.org/build/wallet](https://celo.org/build/wallet) and enter your phone number to be messaged an invitation code. Please note that the Celo Wallet is presently only available for Android, with iOS coming soon.

If you already have an account \(and the corresponding seed phrase\), you can download the Celo wallet from the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.celo.mobile.alfajores) and follow instructions in the app to import your wallet using the seed phrase.

If you need more funds, you can always visit [celo.org/build/faucet](https://celo.org/build/faucet) and enter your address to get more Celo Dollars.
