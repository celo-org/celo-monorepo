# Glossary

Account
: Identifies an account on Celo. There are two types of account. **Externally owned accounts** have an associated Celo Gold balance and are controlled by a user holding the associated public-private keypair. **Contract accounts** contain the code and data of a single smart contract which can be called and manipulate its own stored data.

Address
: A unique identifier for an account on the Celo blockchain.

Blockchain
: A database maintained by a distributed set of computers that do not share a trust relationship or common ownership. This arrangement is referred to as decentralized. The content of a blockchain's database, or ledger, is authenticated using cryptographic techniques, preventing its contents being added to, edited or removed except according to a protocol operated by the network as a whole.

: C Labs, Celo Labs
The team currently leading the development of the Celo protocol and Celo Wallet application.

Celo
: An open platform that makes financial tools accessible to anyone with a mobile phone.

Celo Gold
: Celo's native unit of accounting. The cryptocurrency Celo Gold is equivalent to Ether in Ethereum but is is also an ERC-20 token.

DApp
: Short for Decentralized Application. An application, usually a mobile application, which to deliver its functionality connects to a decentralized network like Celo, rather than to centralized services in a single organization's data centers.

DeFi
: Decentralized Finance; open source software and networks without intermediaries in the financial space.

ERC-20
: A standard interface for implementing cryptocurrencies or tokens as contracts, rather than via account balances.

Ethereum
: A project with which the code of the Celo Blockchain has shared ancestry, [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) facilitates building general-purpose decentralized applications.

EVM
: The Ethereum Virtual Machine is a runtime environment used by smart contracts on Ethereum and Celo.

Savings Circle
: A common practice in societies without easy access to banking (source); a peer-to-peer savings and loan group

SDK
: Software Development Kit. Generally, a suite of developer tools that enable applications to be built on a platform. Celo's SDK currently comprises two components, DAppKit and ContractKit.

Smart Contracts
: Programs that are deployed to a blockchain and execute on its nodes. They operate on data on the blockchain, and on external inputs received in transactions or messages to the blockchain, and may update the state of the blockchain, including account balances. On Celo and Ethereum, smart contracts are written in languages like [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/).
