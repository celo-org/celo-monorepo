# Using the Web Wallet

One easy way to experiment with the Alfajores Testnet is to play with it online. Start with Celo now in 1 minutes. 

### Getting Started

Go to [Celo Toolkit](http://celo.mugglepay.com/), and it's your web wallet. Phone number or app downloads are not necessary.

### Create an account

Click on the button 'Generate Account'. It will generates your Celo account for you, which includes address and PrivateKey as follows:

> Address: 0x1bD6a6c2957194AF6888a950fB9B49ac3012a5d9
> PrivateKey: 0x7ed5e09e3725984021fed755ef08f47361086ab514dbb17c60fb0acd5f4f3fb6

### Get More Funds

If you don't have balance in your account, please click the [Topup (Celo Faucet)](https://celo.org/build/faucet) button. It will give you 10 cUSD and 5 cGLD for free.


If you already have an account, click 'Import Private Keys', and it will load your account and show your account balance.


### Pay with Celo on Web

Once you have Celo Dollar in your account, you can make an online payment to others. Enter the recipient address and amount, and then click 'Pay'.

The transaction will be sent to Celo network, and you can check the explorer by clicking 'Check Status on Celo Blockchain'.

### Security

Please copy or write down the PrivateKey and keep it safe. It shows only once. 

The website is targeted for the testnet now, and more security about the private keys management will be taken more seriously for the mainnet.

Source code is open-sourced. The account is generated and showed on the client side.

We used the version celo@0.3.1, which is generated from Celo NodeJS SDK (@celo/contractkit). It connects with the Celo blockchain.
