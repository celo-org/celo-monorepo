# Using a Ledger with MetaMask

Here are some things to keep in mind when using a Ledger hardware wallet with MetaMask to connect to the Celo network.

* When using MetaMask with a Ledger, users should open the Ethereum app on their Ledger hardware device, not the Celo app.

  \(Users using a Celo-specific wallet with the Ledger should still use the Celo app though\)

* When recovering [Celo sent to an Eth address](https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/eth-recovery), use Metamask with the Ethereum app on the Ledger device.
* When recovering [Eth sent to a Celo address](https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/celo-recovery), use the Celo app on the Ledger device with any Celo wallet.
