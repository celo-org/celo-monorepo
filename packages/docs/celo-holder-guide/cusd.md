# cUSD User Guide

If you intend to hold Celo Dollars (cUSD), exchange CELO for cUSD, or send cUSD to others, this guide will help you access your account and manage your funds.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes:

- You have read [Key Management](../operations-manual/key-management/summary.md) on Celo
- You have installed the [Celo Command Line Interface](../command-line-interface/introduction.md) (Celo CLI)

## Choose a Node

In order to execute the tasks listed below, you will need to point the Celo CLI to a node that is synchronized with the [Mainnet](../getting-started/mainnet.md). There are two options explained [here](quick-start.md#deployment).

## Create an Account

There are two ways to create an account:

- (Recommended) use [accounts generated by Ledger](ledger.md), if you possess a [Ledger hardware wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s)
- Use CLI to [generate an account](../getting-started/running-a-full-node-in-mainnet.md#create-an-account-and-get-its-address) -- this approach is less secure and hence not recommended

After creating an account, record its address in environment variables:

```
export CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=<YOUR-CELO-ACCOUNT-ADDRESS>
```

## Exchange CELO for cUSD

Once you have deposited CELO to your account, you can check your balance:

```
celocli account:balance $CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESSS
```

You can exchange CELO for cUSD using the following command. Note that the unit of value is CELO Wei (1 CELO = 10^18 CELO Wei).

```
celocli exchange:celo --value <VALUE-TO-EXCHANGE> --from $CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

## Transfer cUSD

When you have sufficient balance, you can send cUSD to other accounts. Note that the unit of value is cUSD Wei (1 cUSD = 10^18 cUSD Wei).

```
celocli transfer:dollars --from $CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --to <RECIPIENT-ADDRESS> --value <VALUE-TO-TRANSFER>
```
