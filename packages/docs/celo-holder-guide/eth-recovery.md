In this tutorial, steps are outlined to help you recover your [CELO (previously Celo Gold)](../overview.md#background-and-key-concepts) native assets if you accidentally transferred them to an [Ethereum address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Addresses).

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have access to the following:

- A computer with a [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). You can access it following these instructions:
    - [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/270810/how-to-quickly-launch-a-bash-shell-from-windows-10s-file-explorer/)
    - [Mac](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac)
    - [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/196212/how-do-you-open-a-command-line)
- The [24-word recovery phrase](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase/) of your Ethereum address
