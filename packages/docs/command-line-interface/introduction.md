# Introduction

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

- **You have a Celo node running.** Commands will connect to a Celo node to execute most functionality. See the [Running a Full Node](running-a-full-node.md) instructions for more details on running a full node.

### NPM Package

The Celo CLI is published as a node module on NPM. Assuming you have [npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the Celo CLI using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @celo/celocli
```

{% hint style="info" %}
We are currently deploying the CLI with only Node v10.x LTS support. If you are running a different version of Node, consider using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) to manage your node versions. e.g. with: `nvm install 10 && nvm use 10`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have trouble installing globally (i.e. with the `-g` flag), try installing to a local directory instead with `npm install @celo/celocli` and run with `npx celocli`.
{% endhint %}

### Overview

The tool is broken down into modules and commands with the following pattern:

```text
celocli <module>:<command> <...args> <...flags?>
```

The `celocli` tool assumes that users are running a node which they have access to signing transactions on.
See documentation on the [config](./config.md) module for information about how set which node commands are sent to.
