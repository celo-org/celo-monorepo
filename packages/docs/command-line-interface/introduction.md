# Introduction

## Getting Started

### NPM Package

The Celo CLI is published as a node module on NPM. Assuming you have [npm installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the Celo CLI using the following command:

`$ npm install -g @celo/celocli`

{% hint style="info" %}
We are currently deploying the CLI with only Node v10.x LTS support. If you are running a different version of Node, consider using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) to manage your node versions. e.g. with: `nvm install 10 && nvm use 10`
{% endhint %}

### Docker Image

Additionally, if don't have NPM or are having trouble installing the Celo CLI with your version of node, you can use a docker image that runs the Celo Blockchain client in full sync mode which includes the Celo CLI.

`$ docker pull us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/celocli:master`

For more details on configuring this container, see the [Running a Full Node](../getting-started/running-a-full-node.md) section. You can run the container with the following command.

`$ docker run --name celo_cli_container -it -p 8545:8545 us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/celocli:master -v`

With additional arguments to the image, it can also be run in ultralight sync mode.

`$ docker run --name celo_cli_container -p 8545:8545 --entrypoint=/celo/start_geth.sh us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/celocli:master "/usr/local/bin/geth" "alfajores" "ultralight"`

An interactive shell where the Celo CLI is available can be obtained via the following command. All of the subsequent documentation should be appropriate from this shell.

`$ docker exec -it celo_cli_container /bin/sh`

Make sure to kill the container when you are done.

`$ docker kill celo_cli_container`

### **Prerequisites**

- **You have a full node running.** See the [Running a Full Node](running-a-full-node.md) instructions for more details on running a full node.

### Overview

The tool is broken down into modules and commands with the following pattern:

`celocli <module>:<command> <...args> <...flags?>`

The `celocli` tool assumes that users are running a node which they have access to signing transactions on. The config module is included below for convenience. Use the sidebar to navigate to the other modules.
