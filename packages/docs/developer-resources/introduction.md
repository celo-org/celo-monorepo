# The Celo SDK

Welcome to the Celo SDK Docs Homepage! Here, you can find resources for DAppKit and ContractKit, two resources to allow you to build mobile dApps, apps, and more on Celo.

[ContractKit](contractkit/README.md) is a library to help developers and validators to interact with the celo-blockchain and is well suited to developers looking for an easy way to integrate Celo Smart Contracts within their applications.

[DAppKit](dappkit/README.md) is a lightweight set of functions that allow mobile DApps to use the celo light client bundled with the Celo Wallet to sign transactions and access the user's address. This allows for a less resource-intensive experience for the user (only one client needs to run on the phone) and an easier experience for development, as no light client state/connection management is necessary.

If you'd like to see the Celo SDK expanded to support your favorite technology or application, please join the conversation on the [Celo Forum](https://forum.celo.org) or [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/600834479145353243/600839784700837926) and tell us what you'd like to build- we highly encourage contributions!
