# Listing Guide
Welcome to the Listing Guide documentation page. If you are a digital asset exchange or ranking site, this guide will help you run a node and audit your setup. 

## Support
If you have any questions or need assistance with these instructions, please contact cLabs or ask in the #exchanges channel on [Celo’s Discord server](https://chat.celo.org/). Remember that Discord is a public channel: never disclose recovery phrases (also known as backup keys, or mnemonics), private keys, unsanitized log output, or personal information.

## Important Information
### Celo Native Asset and Celo Dollar

There are two important assets on the Celo network, the Celo native asset (CELO) and the Celo Dollar (cUSD). CELO was called Celo Gold (cGLD) when the contract was deployed, so you will often see references to Celo Gold in the codebase. To learn more about the two, please read [this](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/overview/celo-for-eth-devs#the-celo-native-asset-and-the-celo-dollar) section of the docs.

You can also view the CGP proposal regarding the name change [here](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0003.md) and the forum post about the name change [here](https://forum.celo.org/t/proposal-to-rename-celo-gold-to-celo-native-asset/528).
