# Overview

This section contains information about some of the key tools and resources that will help developers start building applications
on Celo.

## Quick Start Guides

View the [Developer Quick Start page](start.md) to get started using the Celo SDKs with guided coding exercises.

## Tools

### SDKs

- [ContractKit](contractkit/)
  - Javascript package of Celo blockchain utilities
  - Manage connections to the Celo blockchain, accounts, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, etc.
  - A set of wrappers around the core protocol smart contracts to easily connect with contracts related to governance, validators, on-chain exchange, etc.
  - Includes [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.4/)
- [Celo Ethers.js Wrapper](https://github.com/celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper) (*experimental*)
  - A minimal wrapper to make [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) compatible with the Celo network
- [DappKit](dappkit/)
  - Easily connect to the [Valora](http://valoraapp.com/) wallet
  - Valora manages user account, private keys and transaction signing, so you can focus on building your dapp
  - Learn more and see the code with the [Dappkit truffle box](https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-dappkit)

### Infrastructure

- [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) provides a clean, intuitive UI where users can send transactions and interact with smart contracts
- [Forno](forno/)
  - Node access service so you can connect your dapp to the Celo blockchain without having to run node infrastructure
- [ODIS](contractkit/odis.md)
  - Oblivious decentralized identity service
  - Lightweight identity layer that makes it easy to send cryptocurrency to a phone number
- Blockscout block explorers
  - [Alfajores testnet](http://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/) & [mainnet](http://explorer.celo.org/)
- [Stats.celo.org](http://stats.celo.org) to check network activity and health

#### Networks

- [Alfajores Testnet](../getting-started/alfajores-testnet.md)
  - [Faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) for free testnet CELO and cUSD
  - [Forno](forno/) supports connections to alfajores
  - Requires Alfajores Celo wallet for mobile device testing (please request, [support@clabs.co](mailto:support@clabs.co))
- [Baklava testnet](../getting-started/baklava-testnet.md) for validators and testing protocol changes

### Ethereum Tools

- Similarities between Celo and Ethereum means you can use many of the most popular Ethereum developer tools.
  - Celo supports the EVM, so tools for writing smart contracts in Solidity (or any language that compiles to EVM bytecode) are compatible with Celo
  - ERC20, NFT (ERC721) and other smart contract interface standards are supported, see [Celo for Ethereum Developers](celo-for-eth-devs.md)
  - [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
  - [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/)
  - [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
  - Many more

### Ongoing projects

- [Community projects](celo-dapp-gallery.md)
- [Grant recipients](https://celo.org/experience/grants/directory)
- Python & Java SDKs
- Web wallet (like Metamask)
