## [Decentralized Impact Incubator](https://blockchainforsocialimpact.com/incubator-winners-2020/) Winners

### Multiply.Charity by Abundance

[Multiply](https://multiply.charity/) the impact of charitable donations by providing liquidity in credit tokens where the legacy financial system fails. Compared to cash donations, like GiveDirectly, this process has two major advantages: The credit tokens 1\) fill a demand for liquidity \(which banks fail to deliver\), thus increasing the incentive to produce goods and services and 2\) stay in the local economy longer, resulting in a larger impact \(or lower cost overhead\) per donation. Early field tests demonstrate up to 20x impact over traditional donations and double the velocity \(the rate at which the money is traded\) to the US Dollar.

### Bienvenir
