# Docs

Most of the docs package in the [celo-monorepo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo) have been moved to their own [Celo documentation repo](https://github.com/celo-org/docs).

## Celo CLI docs

For now, the autogenerated [cli](../cli) package docs are still output in this docs folder. When updates are made to these autogenerated docs, the updates need to be manually copied to the [command-line-interface](https://github.com/celo-org/docs/tree/main/docs/command-line-interface) folder in the [celo-org/docs repo](https://github.com/celo-org/docs).
