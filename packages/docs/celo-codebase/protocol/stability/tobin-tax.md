# Tobin Tax

If the Celo reserve ratio falls below `tobinTaxReserveRatio`, a small `tobinTax` is levied on Celo Gold transfers. This fee is transferred to the `Reserve` smart contract. There is no gas charged for this transfer. The `tobinTaxReserveRatio` and the `tobinTax` are initially set to `200%` and `0.5%` respectively and are governable.

The total Celo reserve value, expressed in Celo Gold units, is approximated on-chain by dividing the reserve Celo Gold balance by the Celo Gold target asset allocation weight. The Celo reserve ratio is then computed by dividing the total reserve value by the value of Celo Dollar supply expressed in Celo Gold units.
