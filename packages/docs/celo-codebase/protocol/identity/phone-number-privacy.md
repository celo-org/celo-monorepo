# Phone Number Privacy

An important part of the Celo protocol is the ability to link a phone number to a Celo native address. This improves the user experience for sending/receiving payments to a phone's contacts without having to deal with blockchain native addresses. However, it's also important that the phone number mappings remain private, preventing the mass harvesting of mapped phone numbers. This guide provides an overview of the Celo phone number privacy system.

## Understanding the problem

When you send payment to someone in your phone's address book, the mobile client needs to look up the phone number in the on-chain registry to find the mapping to a Celo native address, which can be used to receive the actual payment. If this mapping were in plain text on the Celo blockchain then anyone would be able to trivially see account balances for all numbers. If instead, the hash of each phone number were used as the on chain identifier, it would still be possible to brute force the mapping via a [rainbow table attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table). 

## The solution

The basis of the solution is to use a hashed on-chain identifier that is derived from both the original phone number and a salt that is provided by the Phone Number Privacy (PNP) service. When a user initiates a payment to a phone number, the mobile wallet first queries PNP for the number's salt and then uses this salt to compute the on-chain identifier. When the PNP receives a request, it authenticates the request and ensures the account has not exceeded its quota. Since blockchain accounts and phone numbers are not naturally Sybil-resistant, the PNP uses a set of factors to determine the appropriate quota. 

Quota is influenced by:

- Account balance
- Transaction history
- Phone number attestation count and success rate

The impact that these factors have on the quota are adjusted to make it prohibitively expensive to scrape large quantities of phone numbers while still allowing typical user flows to remain unaffected.

## Decentralized PNP

### Distributed Key Generation

For the sake of user privacy, no single party should have the ability to unilaterally compute the hash for a given number. With this in mind, we've designed the PNP service to be decentralized across a handful of reputable participants. Before the PNP service is deployed, a set of operators participated in a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) ceremony to generate a shared secret. You can find the repository for the [DKG setup here](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-threshold-bls-rs). Each instance of the PNP service holds a share of the key which can be used to sign the response to the user. When enough of these signatures are combined, their combination can be used to derive the phone number salt. The number of key holders (_m_) and threshold of signatures required (_k_) are both configurable at the time of the DKG ceremony.

### Rotating keys

In the case that a key is compromised or a new PNP operator is added, it will be necessary to perform a key rotation. Before going over the key rotation process, let's take a look at the implications of a compromised key. If the number of keys compromised at a time is less than the threshold _k_, the attacker will not be able to reach a sufficient threshold to compute the salt for all phone numbers. Similarly, as long as _k_ other keys remain uncompromised, good users will still be able to perform the salt lookup as part of the PNP service. Therefore, in the case that a single key is compromised, user data will remain private and the service operational; however, it's important that we can detect and perform a key rotation before the number of keys compromised exceeds _k_ or _m - k + 1_ (whichever is lower). For example, if there are ten PNP operators and the required threshold is three, then if three of them are compromised an attacker may compute the salt for all phone numbers. If eight are compromised then an attacker may prevent the rest of the nodes (two in this case) from generating the salt for users. Note that "compromised" entities in these examples could also be malicious or simply unavailable.

To rotate keys, a new DKG ceremony must be performed with at least _k_ of the _m_ original keys. These newly generated keys will not be compatible with the old keys; however if _k_ of the old keys are used, an attacker may still reach the necessary threshold.Therefore, it's extremely important that all of the old keys are destroyed after a successful key rotation. Note that a DKG ceremony also provides the opportunity to change the values for _k_ and _m_.

### Blinding

When the user queries a phone number, the mobile wallet first blinds the phone number locally. After the application receives the response, it unblinds it to retrieve the salt. This blinding process preserves the privacy of the mobile number such that the PNP cannot tell which number it's providing a salt for; reducing risk of targeted censorship and further increasing privacy.  

### Combiner

Due to the multi-service communication that needs to happen as part of the K of M signing, we've created a combiner service which performs the orchestration on the user's behalf. Using the cLabs operated combiner is optional and a client can choose to operate/designate a separate combiner if desired. Because the combiner only receives the blinded phone number, the combiner cannot tell which number it's providing orchestrating services for. The combiner additionally validates the response from each signer to ensure a corrupt signer cannot corrupt the resulting salt.

## Authentication

In order to measure the quota for a given request, the PNP must check the querier's account information on the Celo network. To prove ownership over the account, the header of the API request contains the signed message body. When the PNP receives the request, it authenticates the user by recovering the message signer from the header and comparing it to the value in the message body.

## Architecture

The hosted architecture is divided into two components, the Combiner and the Signer. Both are hosted as serverless cloud functions with public API endpoints. Both services rely upon a [BLS signing library](https://github.com/celo-org/blind-threshold-bls-wasm#e1e2f8a) which is compiled to a Web Assembly module. The Signer also leverages a hosted PostgreSQL database for tracking quotas and an Azure Key Vault instance for managing the BLS key securely.
