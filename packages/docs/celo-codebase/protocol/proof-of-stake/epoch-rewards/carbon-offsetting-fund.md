# Carbon Offsetting Fund

The Carbon Offsetting Fund provides for making the infrastructure of the Celo platform carbon-neutral, by making a transfer every epoch to an organization that commits to using those assets off-chain for carbon offsetting projects.

Through the [on-chain governance process](../../governance.md), CELO holders can set the fraction of the total desired epoch rewards, initially planned to be 0.1%, that is received by the carbon offsetting fund, and the address of a carbon offsetting partner to which to direct these transfers. The on-target amount is adjusted by the epoch [rewards multiplier](./), as with all epoch rewards.
