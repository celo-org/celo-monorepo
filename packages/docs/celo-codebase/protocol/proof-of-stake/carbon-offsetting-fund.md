# Carbon Offsetting Fund

The Carbon Offsetting Fund provides for making the  infrastructure of the Celo platform carbon-neutral, by making a transfer every epoch to an organization that commits to using those assets off-chain for carbon offsetting projects.

Through the on-chain governance process, Celo Gold holders can set an on-target carbon offset amount, and the address of a carbon offsetting partner to which to direct these transfers. The on-target amount is adjusted by the epoch [rewards mulitplier](epoch-rewards.md), as with all epoch rewards.
