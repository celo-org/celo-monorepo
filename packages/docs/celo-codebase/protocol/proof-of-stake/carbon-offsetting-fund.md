# Carbon Offsetting Fund

The Carbon Offsetting Fund provides for making the infrastructure of the Celo platform carbon-neutral, by making a transfer every epoch to an organization that commits to using those assets off-chain for carbon offsetting projects.

Through the [on-chain governance process](../governance.md), Celo Gold holders can set the fraction of the total desired epoch rewards, initially planned to be 0.5%, that is received by the carbon offsetting fund, and the address of a carbon offsetting partner to which to direct these transfers. The on-target amount is adjusted by the epoch [rewards mulitplier](epoch-rewards.md), as with all epoch rewards.
