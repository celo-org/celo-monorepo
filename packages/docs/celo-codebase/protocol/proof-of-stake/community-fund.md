# Community Fund

The Community Fund provides for general upkeep of the Celo platform. Celo Gold holders decide how to allocate these funds through governance proposals. Funds might be used to pay bounties for bugs or vulnerabilities, security audits, or grants for protocol development.

The Community Fund receives assets from three sources:

- The Community Fund obtains a desired epoch payment defined as a fraction of the total desired epoch rewards \(governable, initially planned to be $$25\%$$\). This amount is subject to adjustment up or down in the event of under- or over-spending against the epoch rewards target schedule. It may also be reduced to [bolster the Reserve](#bolster-reserve).

- The Community Fund is the default destination for slashed assets.

- The Community Fund also receives the 'base' portion of [transaction fees](../transactions/gas-pricing.md).

The reserve automatically receives a fraction of the desired epoch payments to the Community Fund during times in which the reserve ratio \(the ratio of reserve value over stablecoin market capitalization\) is below a predefined target schedule. The size of the epoch payment to the reserve is calculated based on a half-life calculation to bring the reserve back to its target level. The reserve ratio target schedule as well as the half-life period \(initially planned to be 10 years\) are governable.
