# Transactions

Transactions in the Celo protocol include payments, contract calls, and other operation which modifies state. They are similar to Ethereum transaction with the following key differences.

- Gas prices must meet or exceed the [gas price minimum](./gas-pricing.md).
- [Gateway fees](./full-node-incentives.md) may included to incentivize full nodes to serve the transaction.
- Gas and gateway fees may be paid in currencies other than the native Celo Gold.
