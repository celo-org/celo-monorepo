# Transactions

Transactions in the Celo protocol include payments, contract calls, and other operation which modifies state. They are similar to Ethereum transaction with the following key differences.

* Gas prices must meet or exceed the [gas price minimum](gas-pricing.md).
* [Gateway fees](full-node-incentives.md) may be included to incentivize full nodes to serve the transaction.
* Gas and gateway fees may be paid in currencies other than the native CELO.
