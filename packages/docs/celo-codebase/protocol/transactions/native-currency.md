# Native Currency

The native currency in the Celo protocol, CELO, conforms to the ERC20 interface. This is made possible by way of a permissioned “Transfer” precompile, which only the CELO ERC20 smart contract can call. The address of the contract exposing this interface can be looked up via the Registry smart contract, and has the “GoldToken” identifier. Note that as the native currency of the protocol, CELO, much like Ether, can still be sent directly via transactions by specifying a non-zero “value”, bypassing the ERC20 interface.
