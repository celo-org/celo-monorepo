# Celo Community Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The Celo Code of Conduct is one of the ways we bring our value of connectedness into practice. A primary goal of the Celo community is to be welcoming and inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. 
As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We invite all those who participate in the Celo community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our own actions and their effects on our community.
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, let us know by emailing community@celo.org.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (users; validators; contributors–paid or otherwise; sponsors; cLabs employees; and others) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community undertakings and venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Use welcoming and inclusive language.
Attempt collaboration before conflict.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, critical, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of this Code of Conduct can result in you being asked to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event (without refund in the case of a paid event), or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.
Celo community members are held accountable, in addition to these guidelines, to their respective employment Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policies. Where applicable, any such staff in violation of this Code of Conduct may be subject to further consequences, such as disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. For Celo community contractors or vendors, violation of this Code of Conduct could affect the continuation or renewal of a contract. 

## Reporting Guidelines
