# README GUIDE FOR CELO DEVELOPERS

## How to publish a new npm package

First checkout the alfajores branch.

```
celo-monorepo $ git checkout alfajores
celo-monorepo $ yarn
```

Before publishing a new celocli package, test in isolation using Docker. This confirms that it is locally installable and does not have implict dependency on rest of the celo-monorepo or have an implicit dependency which is an explicit dependency of another celo-monorepo package.

```
# To test utils package, change $PWD/packages/cli to $PWD/packages/utils
# To test contractkit package, change $PWD/packages/cli to $PWD/packages/contractkit
celo-monorepo $ docker run -v $PWD/packages/cli:/tmp/npm_package -it --entrypoint bash node:10
root@e0d56700584f:/# mkdir /tmp/tmp1 && cd /tmp/tmp1
root@e0d56700584f:/tmp/tmp1# npm install /tmp/npm_package/
```

After testing, exit the docker container, and publish the package. Do note that all our packages are prefixed with "@celo/" and only members listed [here](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/celo/members) can publish new packages or update the existing ones.

```
# Publish the package publicly
celo-monorepo/packages/cli $ yarn publish --access=public
# Increment the version number, after testing, we will push that commit to GitHub
```

Let's say the published package version number 0.0.20, verify that it is installable

```
/tmp/tmp1 $ npm install @celo/cli@0.0.20
```

Add a tag with the most recent git commit of the published branch. Note that this commit comes before package.json is updated with the new package version.

```
$ npm dist-tag add <package-name>@<version> [<tag>]
```

Once you publish do some manual tests, for example, after publishing `celocli`

```
# Docker for an isolated environment again
celo-monorepo $ docker run -it --entrypoint bash node:10
root@e0d56700584f:/# mkdir /tmp/tmp1 && cd /tmp/tmp1
root@e0d56700584f:/tmp/tmp1# npm install @celo/celocli@0.0.20
/tmp/tmp1# ./node_modules/.bin/celocli
