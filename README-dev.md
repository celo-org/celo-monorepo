# README GUIDE FOR CELO DEVELOPERS

## How to run a local testnet

Often when developing, it is useful to create a test network localy using the full celo-blockchain binary to go beyond what can be done with other options such as [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)

The quickest way to get started with a local testnet is by running `yarn celotool local-testnet` from the `monorepo` root.
This command will create a local testnet with a single validator node and deploy all smart contract migrations to it.
Once the network is initialized a NodeJS REPL is provided to help interact with the running nodes.
For more options, consult `yanr celotool local-testnet --help`, which provides an overview of the tool and its options.

## Monorepo inter-package dependencies

Many packages depend on other packages within the monorepo. When this happens, follow these rules:

1.  All packages must use **master version** of sibling packages.
2.  Exception to (1) are packages that represent a GAE/firebase app which must use the last published version.
3.  To differentiate published vs unpublished version. Master version (in package.json) must end with suffix `-dev` and should not be published.
4.  If a developer want to publish a version; then after publishing it needs to set master version to next `-dev` version and change all package.json that require on it.

To check which packages need amending, you can run (in the root pkg):

    yarn check:packages

A practical example:

- In any given moment, `contractkit/package.json#version` field **must** of the form `x.y.z-dev`
- If current version of contractkit is: `0.1.6-dev` and we want to publish a new version, we should:
  - publish version `0.1.6`
  - change `package.json#version` to `0.1.7-dev`
  - change in other packages within monorepo that were using `0.1.6-dev` to `0.1.7-dev`

## How to publish a new npm package

> Note: Packages with mainline versions (i.e. without a `-foo` suffix) should be published from the `master` branch.

> Note: All packages are prefixed with "@celo/" and only members of the [Celo NPM organization](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/celo/members) can publish new packages or update the existing ones.

### Update the version numbers to an unpublished version

It is important to ensure that the `master` branch is ahead of the published package on NPM, otherwise `yarn` may use the published version of the package rather than the local development version.

In order to maintain this, create and merge a PR to the `master` branch bumping the package version to the next number that will be published. (i.e. If you are about to publish `x.y.z`, set the package version to `x.y.z+1`)
Update all references to that package in the monorepo to the new version (i.e. `x.y.z+1`)
Prefer appending a `-dev` suffix to the version number to ensure an internal dependency will never be mistaken for a published one.

> Note: Publishing breaking changes requires an increment to the minor version number for `0.` releases. Once `1.0.0` is pusblished breaking changes are generally prohibited outside the rare major version release. Read the [semver specification](https://semver.org/) for more information.

> Note: Services deployed to App Engine must only depend on published NPM packages. These packages are `blockchain-api` and `notification-service`.

### Checkout the commit to be published and verify version numbers

Checkout the commit that will become the new published version (i.e. `git checkout HEAD~1` assuming that the commit for bumping the version number is `HEAD`)

Check the `package.json` file and remove the `-dev` suffix if present. Additionally remove the `-dev` suffix from any internal dependencies and use ensure they are published (e.g. `@celo/utils`)

### Verify installation in Docker

Test installation in isolation using Docker.
This confirms that it is locally installable and does not have implicit dependency on rest of the `celo-monorepo` or have an implicit dependency which is an explicit dependency of another `celo-monorepo` package.

```
# Specify the package to test. e.g. celocli, contractkit, utils
celo-monorepo $ PACKAGE=cli
celo-monorepo $ docker run --rm -v $PWD/packages/${PACKAGE}:/tmp/npm_package -it --entrypoint bash gcr.io/celo-testnet/circleci-node12:1.0.0
circleci@e0d56700584f:/# mkdir /tmp/tmp1 && cd /tmp/tmp1
circleci@e0d56700584f:/tmp/tmp1# npm install /tmp/npm_package/
```

### Publish the package

```
# Publish the package publicly
celo-monorepo/packages/cli $ yarn publish --access=public
```

Let's say the published package version number 0.0.20, verify that it is installable

```
/tmp/tmp1 $ npm install @celo/cli@0.0.20
```

Add a tag with the most recent git commit of the published branch. Note that this commit comes before package.json is updated with the new package version.

```
$ npm dist-tag add <package-name>@<version> <tag>
```

Additionally, if this version is intended to be used on a deployed network (e.g. `baklava` or `alfajores`), tag the version with all appropriate network names.

```
$ npm dist-tag add <package-name>@<version> <network>
```

Once you publish do some manual tests, for example, after publishing `celocli`

```
# Docker for an isolated environment again
celo-monorepo $ docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash gcr.io/celo-testnet/circleci-node12:1.0.0
circleci@7040a7660754:/$ mkdir /tmp/tmp1 && cd /tmp/tmp1
circleci@7040a7660754:/tmp/tmp1$ npm install @celo/celocli@0.0.48
...
circleci@7040a7660754:/tmp/tmp1$ ./node_modules/.bin/celocli
