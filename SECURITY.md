# Security

## Security Announcements

> Public announcements of new releases with security fixes and of disclosure of any vulnerabilities will be made in the Celo Forum's [Security Announcements](https://forum.celo.org/c/security-announcements/) channel.

# Reporting a Vulnerability
 We’re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Celo community. All reports are thoroughly investigated.

### **Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning any vulnerability.

The Celo community asks that all suspected vulnerabilities be privately and responsibly disclosed.

## Creating a report:
1. Submit your vulnerability to [Celo on Intigriti](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/clabs/clabs/detail).
	- This is currently a public program
2. You can also email the [security@clabs.co](mailto:security@clabs.co) list with the details of reproducing the vulnerability as well as the usual details expected for all bug reports.

## Primary Focus 
- Celo protocol, but the team may be able to assist in coordinating a response to a vulnerability in the third-party apps or tools in the Celo ecosystem.

# General
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In case that a reported vulnerability was already known to the company from their own tests, it will be flagged as a duplicate
- Theoretical security issues with no realistic exploit scenario(s) or attack surfaces, or issues that would require complex end user interactions to be exploited, may be excluded or be lowered in severity
- Spam, social engineering and physical intrusion
- DoS/DDoS attacks or brute force attacks
- Vulnerabilities that are limited to non-current browsers (older than 3 versions) will not be accepted
- Attacks requiring physical access to a victim’s computer/device, man in the middle or compromised user accounts
- Recently discovered zero-day vulnerabilities found in in-scope assets within 14 days after the public release of a patch or mitigation may be reported, but are usually not eligible for a bounty.
- Reports that state that software is out of date/vulnerable without a proof-of-concept
