### Issue Title

### Challenge Description
[comment]: # Be as descriptive as possible about what you want to see built. Challenges should be useful to Celo, but open-ended enough to allow for creativity from hackers.

### Submission Requirements
[comment]: # What constitutes a valid/good submission to win the bounty? Would you like a demo included in the submission (Strongly Recommended)? What will help you determine whether a submission passed a threshold of acceptable quality? Please include any relevant code contribution guidelines/standards, etc. Is there any criteria?
[comment]: # How will we ultimately decide the winner/winners from all valid submissions? Typically clean successful PR merge? First valid submission received? Best submission meeting some criteria by the deadline? 
[comment]: # We review the submissions as early as possible (sometimes immediately upon submission) to ensure prompt winner announcement and payout.
