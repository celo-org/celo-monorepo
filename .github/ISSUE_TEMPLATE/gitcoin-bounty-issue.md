### Issue Title

### Challenge Description

Be as descriptive as possible about what you want to see built. Challenges should be useful to Celo, but open-ended enough to allow for creativity from hackers.

### Submission Requirements

What constitutes a valid/good submission to win the bounty? Would you like a demo included in the submission (Strongly Recommended)? What will help you determine whether a submission passed a threshold of acceptable quality? Please include any relevant code contribution guidelines/standards, etc. Is there any criteria?

How will we ultimately decide the winner/winners from all valid submissions? Typically clean successful PR merge? First valid submission received? Best submission meeting some criteria by the deadline? 

We review the submissions as early as possible (sometimes immediately upon submission) to ensure prompt winner announcement and payout.
