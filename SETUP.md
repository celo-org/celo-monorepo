## Reading

Review the README from each directory in [packages](packages/). The [protocol](packages/protocol) and [mobile](packages/mobile) packages are good starting points.


## Getting everything installed

Follow these steps to get everything that you need installed to build the celo-monorepo codebase on your computer.

### Common stuff

#### Install Go

We need Go for [celo-blockchain], the Go Celo implementation, and `gobind` to build Java language bindings to Go code for the Android Geth client).

Note: We currently use Go 1.13. [Install Go 1.13 manually](https://golang.org/dl/), then run

```
go get golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gobind
```

Execute the following (and make sure the lines are in your `~/.bash_profile`):

```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

#### Install Node

Install `nvm` (allows you to manage multiple versions of Node) by following the instructions here: [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm].

Once `nvm` is successfully installed, restart the terminal and run the following commands to install the `npm` versions that [celo-monorepo] will need:

```bash
# restart the terminal after installing nvm
nvm install 8
nvm install 10
nvm alias default 10
```

### MacOS

#### Xcode CLI

Install the Xcode command line tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Homebrew

Install [Homebrew], the best way of managing packages on OSX:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### Install Yarn

We use Yarn to build all of the [celo-monorepo] repo. Install it using [Homebrew](#homebrew):

```bash
brew install yarn
```

### Linux

#### Install Yarn

We use Yarn to build all of the [celo-monorepo] repo. Install it by running the following:

```bash
# for documentation on yarn visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
```

### Optional

#### Install Rust

We use Rust for some [cryptography repositories](https://github.com/celo-org?q=&type=&language=rust) This is not 
required if you only want use the blockchain, monorepo, and mobile wallet.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Now lets add Rust to the PATH:

```
echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/.cargo/bin/" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

With Rust binaries in your PATH you should be able to run:

```bash
rustup install 1.42.0
rustup default 1.42.0
```

If you're building Geth for Android, you need a NDK that has a cross-compilation toolchain. We need version 19.

On Mac (darwin):
```bash
brew cask install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/a39a95824122da8448dbeb0b0ca1dde78e5a793c/Casks/android-ndk.rb

export ANDROID_NDK=/usr/local/share/android-ndk
```

In `celo-blockchain`, define the relevant environment variables, e.g.:

```bash
export NDK_VERSION=android-ndk-r19c
```

and run `make ndk_bundle`. This will download the NDK for your platform.


## Building celo-monorepo

Clone the [celo-monorepo] repo:

```bash
mkdir ~/celo
cd celo
git clone https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo.git
```

Then install the packages:

```bash
cd celo-monorepo
npm install lerna
# install dependencies and run post-install script
yarn
# build all packages
yarn build
```

> Note that if you do your checkouts with a different method, Yarn will fail if
> you havenâ€™t used git with ssh at least once previously to confirm the
> github.com host key. Clone a repo or add the github host key to
> `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and then try again.

> When removing a dependency via `yarn remove some-package`, be sure to also run `yarn postinstall` so
> you aren't left with freshly unpackaged modules. This is because we use `patch-package`
> and the `postinstall` step which uses it is not automatically run after using `yarn remove`.


## Running the mobile wallet

To build and run the mobile wallet on your iOS or Android devices see the guide in the [mobile](packages/mobile) directory.
